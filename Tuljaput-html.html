        Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj the founder of the Maratha kingdom, always
        visited this temple to seek blessings. The legend has to its credit to
        say that the Goddess gave him a sword called ‘Bhavani kadga’' by using
        which Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was successful in his expeditions.The
        history of the temple dates back to the days of ' Skanda Purana ' as it
        finds a mention in that holy script. According to the epic story, there
        was a sage "Kardam" and his consort "Anubhuthi’ with an infant, in this
        area. After his death his wife "Anubhuthi" performed a penance for
        goddess in the name of Bhavani on the banks of river "Mandakini" to look
        after her child. There was a demon (Rakshasa) by name “Kukur" who
        tortured her. Then Goddess Bhavani rescued Anubhuthi and killed the
        demon. The goddess on the prayer of her pet devotee settled on the hill
        of "Bala ghat". Since then the Mother Goddess came to be called as
        Bhavani of Tuljapur or Tulja Bhavani.

        and Matangi Devi on either side of this door. As you move forward from
